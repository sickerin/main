.  At this stage, you are in Guest mode and you will not be able to execute any commands yet.
You need to login to your account before you can use the application.

.  Once logged in, you can type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all patients

* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list
