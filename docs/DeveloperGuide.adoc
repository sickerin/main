By: `CS2103-AY1819S2-W13-4`      Since: `January 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/giatros/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.giatros.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S2-W13-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `CS2103-AY1819S2-W13-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `GiatrosBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Giatros book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store an `Allergy` list in `Giatros book`, which `Patient` can reference. This would allow `Giatros book` to only require one `Allergy` object per unique `Allergy`, instead of each `Patient` needing their own `Allergy` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Giatros book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.giatrosbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::authentication[]
=== User authentication feature
==== Current Implementation

The user account mechanism is facilitated by `GiatrosBook`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `GiatrosBook#addAccount(Account)` -- Saves the new account.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#getAccount(Account)`. The following commands will
invoke the aforementioned operations:

* `Command#LoginCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#getAccount(Account)`.
* `Command#RegisterCommand()` -- Invokes `Model#addAccount(Account)`.

Given below are usage  scenarios and how each of the command and its respective operations behave at each
step which involves two components, `Logic` which is responsible for parsing the user input and `Model` which is
responsible for manipulating the list, if necessary. Both components are extended by `LogicManager` and
`ModelManager` respectively.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `register` command works:

image::RegisterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.1: Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `register` command_

[NOTE]
====
** We assume the user is already logged in to an account with appropriate privilege level (e.g. Administrator)
** If the username already exists, a warning message will be shown to the user to select another username
====

Step 1. The user executes `register id/ces pw/1122qq n/Chua Eng Soon` command to create a new user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `GiatrosBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#RegisterCommand()` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#RegisterCommand()`, `rc` which is instantiated in
Step 3. The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#RegisterCommand()` invokes a request to add the account
into the storage by calling `Model#addAccount(Account)`.

Step 5: The new account is added into the storage. Then, a `CommandResult` is generated and returned to
`LogicManager` which is used to display the result to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `login` command works:

image::LoginSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
_Figure 4.2.1.2: Sequence diagram to illustrate component interactions for the `login` command_

[NOTE]
We assume the user will enter the correct password. Otherwise, warning message will be shown to the user to re-enter
the credential

Step 1. The user executes `login id/ces pw/1122qq` command to login to an existing user account.

Step 2. `LogicManager` invokes the `GiatrosBookParser#parseCommand()` method which takes in the user input
as arguments.

Step 3. When the command is parsed, the `Command#LoginCommand()` will be created which is returned to the
`LogicManager`.

Step 4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute()` method of the `Command#LoginCommand()`, `lc` which is instantiated in
Step 3. The `Model` component will be involved as the `Command#LoginCommand()` invokes a request to retrieve an account
based on the username. If it exists, the account will be retrieved and the password hash will be compared. If it
matches, then the credential is valid and the user is authenticated.
// end::authentication[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGiatrosBook`.
It extends `GiatrosBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `giatrosBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGiatrosBook#commit()` -- Saves the current Giatros book state in its history.
* `VersionedGiatrosBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous Giatros book state from its history.
* `VersionedGiatrosBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone Giatros book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`, `Model#undoGiatrosBook()` and `Model#redoGiatrosBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGiatrosBook` will be initialized with the initial Giatros book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Giatros book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the Giatros book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`, causing the modified state of the Giatros book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `giatrosBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Giatros book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`, causing another modified Giatros book state to be saved into the `giatrosBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`, so the Giatros book state will not be saved into the `giatrosBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGiatrosBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Giatros book state, and restores the Giatros book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Giatros book state, then there are no previous Giatros book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGiatrosBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoGiatrosBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Giatros book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `giatrosBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Giatros book state, then there are no undone giatros book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGiatrosBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the giatros book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`, `Model#undoGiatrosBook()` or `Model#redoGiatrosBook()`. Thus, the `giatrosBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGiatrosBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `giatrosBookStateList`, all giatros book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire giatros book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of giatros book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedGiatrosBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::addremall[]
=== Add/Remove Allergy Feature
==== Current Implementation

The add and remove allergy feature is implemented to extend the functionality of `Allergy` tags.
Currently, the `edit` command will overwrite the existing `Allergy` tags if user attempts to edit the existing `Allergy`.
With the `addall` and `remall` command, it is now possible to add or remove a single or multiple allergies associated with a patient.

The functionality of the classes related to `addall` and `remall` are listed below:

* `AddallCommandParser` and `RemallCommandParser` -- Reads the user input and create `AddallCommand` and `RemallCommand` object respectively.
* `AddallCommand` and `RemallCommand` -- When executed, the command will result in the addition or removal of a single or multiple allergies.
* `Allergy` -- An object that models allergy. It contains a String describing the name of the allergy.

A patient's `Allergy` is stored in a Java HashSet, which stores only unique `Allergy` object.
This feature makes use of this behaviour of a HashSet to allow user to add or remove allergies from the patient.

* `addall` command uses the `.addAll()` method, which takes in a set of `Allergy` objects and add them in if they are not inside the set already.
* `remall` command uses the `.remAll()` method, which takes in a set of `Allergy` objects and remove them if they are actually inside in the set.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add allergy mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and logs into the STAFF account.

Step 2. Assuming that the patient list is not empty, the user executes `addall 1 y/newallergy` to add newallergy to the first patient in the list.

Step 3. This command in string format will be passed to the AddallCommandParser, which will check if the command format is valid.

Step 4. Since this command has a valid format, the system will create a new AddallCommand object, which will be executed.

Step 5. The system will locate the first patient in the patient list, and adds the non-existing allergy to the unique list of patient allergy.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add allergy operation works:

image::AddAllergySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The remove allergy mechanism behaves similarly to the add allergy mechanism. Below is the example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user launches the application and logs into the STAFF account.

Step 2. Assuming that the patient list is not empty, the user executes `remall 1 y/existingallergy` to remove existingallergy to the first patient in the list.

Step 3. This command in string format will be passed to the AddallCommandParser, which will check if the command format is valid.

Step 4. Since this command has a valid format, the system will create a new AddallCommand object, which will be executed.

Step 5. The system will locate the first patient in the patient list, and removes the existing allergy from the unique list of patient allergy.

The following sequence diagram shows how the remove allergy operation works:

image::RemoveAllergySequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Data structure to support the add/remove allergy commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a HashSet to store the list of allergy.
** Pros: Supports the addition and removal of allergy. Additionally, by storing unique list of allergy, we minimise the risk of inputting duplicate allergy by accident.
** Cons: Slightly harder to implement as compared to a String representation.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a String to store the list of allergy.
** Pros: Easier to implement when compared to using a HashSet.
** Cons: Every time we add or remove an allergy, we need to retype the whole lists of allergies because the previous String will simply be overwritten by the new String.

// end::addremall[]

// tag::addremapt[]
=== Add/Remove Appointment Feature
==== Current Implementation


The add and remove appointment feature is implemented to extend the functionality of `Appointment` tags.
Currently, the `edit` command will overwrite the existing `Appointment` tags if user attempts to edit the existing `Appointment`.
With the `addapt` and `remapt` command, it is now possible to add or remove a single or multiple appointments associated with a patient.

The functionality of the classes related to `addapt` and `remapt` are listed below:

* `AddaptCommandParser` and `RemaptCommandParser` -- Reads the user input and create `AddaptCommand` and `RemaptCommand` object respectively.
* `AddaptCommand` and `RemaptCommand` -- When executed, the command will result in the addition or removal of a single or multiple appointments.
* `Appointment` -- An object that models appointment. It contains a String describing the name of the appointment.

A patient's `Appointment` is stored in a Java HashSet, which stores only unique `Appointment` object.
This feature makes use of this behaviour of a HashSet to allow user to add or remove appointments from the patient.

* `addapt` command uses the `.addapt()` method, which takes in a set of `Appointment` objects and add them in if they are not inside the set already.
* `remapt` command uses the `.remapt()` method, which takes in a set of `Appointment` objects and remove them if they are actually inside in the set.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add appointment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and logs into the STAFF account.

Step 2. Assuming that the patient list is not empty, the user executes `addapt 1 apt/2019-01-01 15:30` to add a new appointment at 2019-01-01 15:30 to the first patient in the list.

Step 3. This command in string format will be passed to the AddaptCommandParser, which will check if the command format is valid.

Step 4. Since this command has a valid format, the system will create a new AddaptCommand object, which will be executed.

Step 5. The system will locate the first patient in the patient list, and adds the non-existing appointment to the unique list of patient appointment.

The process is described in sequence diagram shown below:
The following sequence diagram shows how the add appointment operation works:

image::AddAppointmentActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: CRUD appointments

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The appointment began as a refactoring of the tags implementation, with additional features added on later that allowed for easier modification of appointments. So currently each appointment is associated with a patient.

** Pros: A doable task within the time limit, allows displaying of clear and multiple appointments
** Cons: We ideally want to store appointments as dates, to allow us to sort them; Connect doctor objects to the appointments, etc.

* **Alternative 2 : ** Storing an appointment list, so that it'll only require one appointment object per unique appointment.

** Pros: An appointment object is not tied down to a Patient, since there could be multiple stakeholders in v2.0 implementation. I.e nurses, pharmacists, family of patients.
** Cons: But compared to tags, appointments would be much more unique and tied to a patient. I.e many patients can have a coconut allergy, but how many patients can have an appointment with Dr.Oz at 10 AM on Christmas?

===== Aspect: Data structure to store appointment

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a hash set to store appointments

** Pros: Guarantees unique elements, and constant run time.
** Cons: The hash function and other factors some what determine the order in which in the appointments are stored. Currently it's stored as a string, so the order is to some extent random with hiccups here and there.

* **Alternative 2 :** Use a sorted set to store appointments. Appointments as date objects.

** Pros: Guarantees unique elements, and we can have the elements stored in a sorted fashion.
** Cons: Not too many. It's doable, but I didn't have time.

// end::addremapt[]

// tag::export[]
=== Export Feature
==== Current Implementation
The following feature is mainly used to export data for report analysis.
The export feature is available to admin only.

The functionality of the classes related to `export` are listed below:

* `ExportCommandParser` -- Reads the user input and creates `ExportCommand`.
* `ExportCommand` -- When executed, the command will result in a cvs file saved on the local disk at the specified `DESTINATION`.
* `DESTINATION` can end with an extension of .csv or end as a path to a directory.
* Existing data file at `DESTINATION` will be overwritten.
* A table view of the exported data will appear on execution of command.
* .csv files can be opened and edited in Microsoft Excel

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and logs into the STAFF account.

Step 2. Assuming that the patient list is not empty, the user executes `export` to save the current Giastro's book to a csv file

Step 3. This command in string format will be passed to the ExportCommandParser, which will check if the command format is valid.

Step 4. Since this command has a valid format, the system will create a new ExportCommand object, which will be executed.

Step 5. The system will locate the the desired destination, and save the giastrobook.csv file to the path.

The process is described in sequence diagram shown below:
The following sequence diagram shows how the add appointment operation works:

==== Design Consideration
* Create different csv files for each type of user. Due to only having patients in our book, we can currently only create csv files for that type of user.
* Create cvs file for filtered lists

===== Aspect:

// end::export[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.giatros.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.giatros.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.giatros.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.giatros.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/giatros/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Giatros Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
