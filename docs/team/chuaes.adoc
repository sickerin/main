== PROJECT: Giatros by CS2103 AY1819S2 W13-4

---

== Overview

Hi! I am Chua Eng Soon, a Computer Science undergraduate in National University of Singapore. Giatros is my first software engineering project under CS2103.

An introduction is as such:

Giatros is a desktop patient record application that allows staff to keep track of patient data in a hospital. Written in Java, the user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
With the authentication and user management components, these restrict people without proper credentials from viewing or editing information.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *User Authentication feature*
** What it does: Prevents user without proper credentials from executing role-restricted command and viewing of sensitive information.
** Justification: This feature provides *data protection* for sensitive information from user without proper credential.
